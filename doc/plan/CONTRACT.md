 * preferred channel of communication (e.g., Zoom, e-mail, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.) groupchat!
 * preferred GIT workflow - make branches for your work and commit code frequently
 

### Meetings 
 * how to communicate action items made during the meeting
 * policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to make up for it - just communicate pls
 * policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting - group should come to a decision democratically


### Communications
 * decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?) 
 * response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours) within 24 hours is the worst case scenario but the faster the better 
 * policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates git commits and planning doc and through the groupchat


### Commitments
 * what does it mean to work to the "best of your ability"
 * how to set internal deadlines - will probably be making different groups within the team that work on different parts of the project, so those groups should set the deadlines for themselves in alignment with the bigger group deadlines and we should all communicate and be on the same page
 * how to provide commitments others on the team can rely on
 * policy for resolving failure to meet commitments


### Helping each other
 * best ways to and when to ask for help - ask people working on similar parts and also just ask in the group chat, propose pair programming sessions
