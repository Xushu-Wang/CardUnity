2. Mockup basic JSON printing functionality,
3. Modify basic version to output full `Game` model,
4. Design JUnit testing classes & test key functionalities.
5. Implement file chooser UI,

5. Design JUnit testing classes & test key functionalities.

## Other backlog items
1. Create a `Group` class with subclasses `Hand`, `Deck`, `Discard`, and `Set` to represent card groups. 
2. Implement a `Phase` class to represent each phase of a turn and the game. 
3. Create a `Conditions` class to represent the conditions that must be met for a given phase. 
4. Develop a `Players` class to represent players in the game. 
5. Create a `Turns` class to represent each turn in the game. 
6. Develop a `Round` class to represent each round in the game. 
7. Implement a `Game` class to represent the game and include a `Round` object. 
8. Develop a `GameController` class to manage the game, including win conditions, instructions for setup, rounds, turns, and phases. 
9. Create a `GameBuilder` class to generate the JSON file for a game. 
10. Implement a `GameRunner` class to run the game using the JSON file generated by the `GameBuilder`. 
11. Develop a `Parser` class to parse the JSON file and create the game model. 
12. Implement the ability for the user to specify rules and conditions for each phase of the game in the `GameBuilder`. 
13. Add the ability for the user to specify the number of players in the `GameBuilder`.

16. Create a class for each card game to store game-specific rules and conditions. 
17. Implement the ability for the user to specify win conditions in the `GameBuilder`. 
18. Develop the ability for the user to specify the number of cards in each player's hand in the `GameBuilder`.
