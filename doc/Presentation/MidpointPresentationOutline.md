# Overview
* Start by presenting your team's goals for the project, focusing on how you are managing the
  project regularly to ensure it is finished and everyone is contributing:
    * what genre or game are you focusing on and what commonalities and differences have you
      identified
    * what features (including optional ones) you are planning to work on
    * what you prioritized accomplishing for each Sprint
# Design
* Then present your team's design, focusing on the APIs and their behavior instead of implementation
  decisions and class state:
    * describe your current design and framework goals: what is expected to be flexible/open and
      what is fixed/closed
    * provide an overview of the project's core parts: what is each responsible for, how does it
      depend on other parts, what does it encapsulate, and how can new features be plugged in to it
    * describe two APIs in detail:
        * what service does it provide?
        * how does it provide for extension?
        * how does it support users (your teammates) to write readable, well design code?
    * describe two Use Cases in detail that show off how to use each of the APIs described above
    * describe one alternative design considered and what trade-offs led to it not being chosen
# Functionality
* Finally, present your project's current functionality, focusing on telling stories about how you
  are creating flexibility for game variations:
    * run the program from the master branch through a planned series of steps/interactions (
      including showing how bad data or interactions are handled â€” if any are yet)
      NOTE, as each feature is shown, someone on the team should briefly describe how work they did
      over the past week relates to it
    * show any data files that have been created and describe how they are used within your
      program (focus on the file content rather than the code that uses it)
    * show a variety of JUnit and TestFX tests and discuss how comprehensively they cover the
      feature(s) and why you chose the values used in the tests
