## To Modify Builder Help Docs:
1. Each Builder window has a corresponding help document (pdf), which is called by `ParsePDFs.java`,
2. PDFs are named according to the following format: `<View Name>_Help.pdf`,
3. The document files can be found in `resources/BuilderUI/BuilderHelpFiles/`,
4. Help docs should be kept brief and to-the-point, the PDF format allows for easy integration of diagrams/figures/photos if needed
