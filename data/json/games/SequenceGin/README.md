Sequence Gin with RandomRemove

#7 Sequence Gin

Howard Fosdick’s variation of Gin Rummy offers an intriguing take – Player draw two cards in the first stage, 
players can only meld sequence (not three or four of a kind). You score a point for each card (per card bonus) 
in a long sequence of six or more cards. In sequences, you also score a point for each face card – K, Q, J 
(per card bonus). Also, at the end of the turn, a random card is removed from the player. 

Every other rule is as per normal Gin, given above.
